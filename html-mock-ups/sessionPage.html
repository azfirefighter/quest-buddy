                            We need to keep looking in the rest of the cemetary.</p>
                        <p>ariel@gmail said: We found a plaque that said, "Now my charms are all o'erthrown,
                            And what strength I have's mine own,
                            Which is most faint: now, 'tis true,
                            I must be here confined by you,
                            Or sent to Naples. Let me not,
                            Since I have my dukedom got
                            And pardon'd the deceiver, dwell
                            In this bare island by your spell;
                            But release me from my bands
                            With the help of your good hands:
                            Gentle breath of yours my sails
                            Must fill, or else my project fails,
                            Which was to please. Now I want
                            Spirits to enforce, art to enchant,
                            And my ending is despair,
                            Unless I be relieved by prayer,
                            Which pierces so that it assaults
                            Mercy itself and frees all faults.
                            As you from crimes would pardon'd be,
                            Let your indulgence set me free.

                            Then say if they be true. This mis-shapen knave,
                            His mother was a witch, and one so strong
                            That could control the moon, make flows and ebbs,
                            And deal in her command without her power.
                            These three have robb'd me; and this demi-devil—
                            For he's a bastard one—had plotted with them
                            To take my life. Two of these fellows you
                            Must know and own; this thing of darkness I
                            Acknowledge mine.
